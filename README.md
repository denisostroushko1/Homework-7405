# Homework-7405

Homework for Fall 2022 PUBH 7405 at the University of Minnesota. While writing these homework I put in extra time to format the graphs and 
tables using R packages. I found a lot of cool ways to present tables with summary statistics, as well as test and models output. I also 
found a lot of useful packages that interact with `ggplot` mainly. 

Also, textbook and lecture materials cover way more intro-level regression methods and theory, and I wish to use this file as a table of 
contents. 

By default, I use `kable`, `kableExtra`, `tidyverse`, and `ggplot2` a lot, so I will only be making notes of new packages 
I find and use for the analysis. 

# HW1

* Statistical Concepts: 

  + two-sample t-test, two-sample Wilcoxon test for difference in medians
  + test of independence for two continuous variables using Pearson's and Spearman's Rho correlation coefficients 
  + z-transformation for correlation coefficient confidence interval 
  
* Implementation via R code
  + pooled standard error calculation for the two-sample difference in means  
  + transformation to and from z-scale for Pearson's correlation coefficient confidence interval 

# HW2

* Statistical Concepts: 
  + Simple Linear Regression 
  + Prediction of average response level $\large \hat Y_h$, estimation of standard error for the estimate
  + Prediction of a response $\large \hat Y_h$ for a single observation, estimation of standard error for the estimate
  + Overall ANOVA test for the regression model 
  + Calculation of $F^*$ cutoff statistic and p-value using degrees of freedom for the overall ANOVA test and 
  
* Implementation via R code
  + Calculation of SLR model estimates $\large \hat \beta_i$ using formulas
  + Average response and a single observation estimate, standard error, and C.I. for a given value of X
